        <h2>QUETTA: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf central<br> parliamentary board, headed by Prime Minister Imran
            Khan,<br> has withdrawn the party ticket awarded to business tycoon <br>Abdul Qadir in Balochistan for the
            Senate election after<br> strong opposition from the PTI provincial leadership.</h2>
        <p>The party high command decided to take back ticket from Abdul Qadir<br> and nominated Zahoor Agha for the
            Senate election on a general seat, said<br> Adviser to the Prime Minister Shahbaz Gill on Saturday.
            “Withdrawal of party ticket <br>from Abdul Qadir is correct,” the adviser said, explaining that <br>Mr Agha
            would be party candidate from Balochistan in the Senate election.<br> Opposing the award of party ticket to
            Abdul Qadir, PTI’s provincial leadership <br>argued that he did not belong to the PTI as he had been a
            member of <br>the ruling Balochistan Awami Party (BAP) till last week. The party provincial spokesman<br>
            Asif Tareen also confirmed to Dawn that Zahoor Agha would contest <br>the Senate election on general seat
            from Balochistan as the party <br>withdrew its ticket from Mr Qadir.</p>
